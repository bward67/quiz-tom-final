This was my first proper React project. So - Yayee ME! I took some time off from doing the front end mentor challenges to learn React and now there is no looking back. I will play around with some more projects until I am FORMIDABLE and then I think I will redo some or all of the FEM challenges in react. But as for this quiz app which I made for my husband - I will keep changing the questions from time to time to keep him out of my hair!
